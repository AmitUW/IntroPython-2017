Course Textbook

There is no textbook to purchase.

We have determined over time that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work well for the diverse skills and backgrounds of students in class.  Thus, rather than requiring that everyone purchase a single text, we supply many resources, most of which are free (as in free beer) and available online.  We also encourage you to purchase or find your own texts and references.  If you have a special interest in, for instance, data visualization, machine learning or game programming, find a reference and bring it and your questions to weekly office hours.  By the time you get to the third course in the series this will feel natural. Indeed it is the way we work as professionals in the field, each of us individually or in small teams finding the tools and resources we need to further our interests, skills and careers.



Disability Accommodation
Your experience in this class is important to us, and it is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you experience barriers based on disability, please seek a meeting with DRS to discuss and address them. If you have already established accommodations with DRS, please communicate your approved accommodations to your instructor at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.

Disability Resources for Students (DRS) offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities.  Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.  If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary or permanent disability that requires accommodations (this can include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu
